A script to calculate Linear Approximation Table for a 256 bytes-box. The script produces lat.txt which contains formatted LAT table and pollokck.png containing visual graph where each pixel represents the value of corresponding table position. The script takes a moment to execute so have some patience.

This is some glued together code borowed from:
